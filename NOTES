- "Alt sets MSB" input can't be easily translated to Unicode due to
  issues with copy/paste. When pasting Unicode, all of an APL
  character's octets will have their MSBs set. Depending on the
  codepoint after masking off the MSB, each octet will either get
  mistranslated as an APL character or dropped because it doesn't have
  an entry in akt's map.

  The only way to correctly handle this situation is with a state
  machine to recognize Unicode and pass it through to the output
  unaltered. Given the prevalence of Unicode and the obsolescence of
  "Alt sets MSB" encodings, akt will not support this mode of
  operation.
