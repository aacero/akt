akt NOTES
=========

Is there a catch? Of course. There always is... Modern terminal emulators
send cursor keys as a sequence of characters beginning with a "control
sequence introducer" (CSI) -- the characters `ESC [` -- or with the the
sequence `ESC O` (commonly sent by arrow keys).

`akt`'s keyboard mapping uses `Alt [` to produce the `←` character. Yes,
this is exactly the same as the CSI. `akt` attempts to disambiguate
the two cases by looking at the timing of the next character to arrive.
If 20 ms passes with no further input after the `Alt [`, `akt` assumes
that the sequence should translate to `←`. If `akt` receives another
character within 20 ms of `Alt [`, it assumes that the next character
is really following a CSI; `akt` then passes the CSI and subsequent
characters to the output untranslated.

This timing-based approach works well for the most part. The approach can
fall apart, though, on a system suffering from high load or if you've just
arrived from 1980 and are accessing your system across a slow serial line.

Certain older terminal emulators may offer an "Alt sets MSB" option. This
is incompatible with `akt`.
