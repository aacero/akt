	* akt.c (handle_key_timer, find_listener, handle_watchdog_timer)
	(key_timer_arm, key_timer_disarm, initalize, finalize, main):
	Ctrl-C handling: sends SIGINT to process on receiving end of
	stdout pipe. If no pipe, Ctrl-C exits akt. Also, akt exits when
	the process on the receiving end of the stdout pipe exits. NUL
	input characters (Ctrl-@, Ctrl-` or Ctrl-space) are now passed
	through to output rather than being used to exit akt.
	Miscellaneous code cleanup. Bumped version to 1.1.

	* akt.c (map[], alarm): Correct mappings of A-., A-> and A-K. Set
	timer on ESC to allow bare ESC to also be passed through.
