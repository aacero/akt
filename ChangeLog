	* akt.c (usage, main): Version 1.2.1: Pulled out the Alt-sets-MSB
	input support, which is fundamentally incompatible with copy/paste
	of UTF-8. See NOTES for further explanation.

	* akt.c (usage, main): Version 1.2: Command line option -n causes
	akt to pass Ctrl-C to output rather than signaling the listener.
	Input is now checked to confirm that it's a terminal. Input
	characters having MSB (bit 7) set are now translated to APL; this
	means that older terminal emulators which use the MSB as the Alt
	shift bit will be supported by akt.

	* akt.c (handle_key_timer, find_listener, handle_watchdog_timer)
	(key_timer_arm, key_timer_disarm, initalize, finalize, main):
	Ctrl-C handling: sends SIGINT to process on receiving end of
	stdout pipe. If no pipe, Ctrl-C exits akt. Also, akt exits when
	the process on the receiving end of the stdout pipe exits. NUL
	input characters (Ctrl-@, Ctrl-` or Ctrl-space) are now passed
	through to output rather than being used to exit akt.
	Miscellaneous code cleanup. Bumped version to 1.1.

	* akt.c (map[], alarm): Correct mappings of A-., A-> and A-K. Set
	timer on ESC to allow bare ESC to also be passed through.
